# Low Level Mosaic Variant Caller

This R script implements customized pipeline for detection of low level somatic mosaicism (VAF < 10%) in parental samples.  Candidate mosaic variants are detected based on the analysis of VCF and BAM files from the cohort of WES trios. 

Script was designed to work with data generated at Human Genome Sequencing Ceter at Baylor College of Medicing using Mercury pipeline.
